/**
 * ext.h — BEP 10 Extension Protocol + BEP 9 ut_metadata
 *
 * BEP 10 defines a generic extension handshake that peers exchange
 * immediately after the standard BitTorrent handshake.  It maps
 * extension names to local message IDs.
 *
 * BEP 9 defines "ut_metadata", an extension that lets peers share
 * the torrent info-dict without a .torrent file.  The info-dict is
 * split into 16 KiB blocks; a peer that has the full metadata can
 * serve individual blocks on request.
 *
 * Together these two BEPs are the minimum needed to make magnet links
 * actually download — you locate peers via DHT, shake hands, negotiate
 * the extension protocol, then fetch the metadata block-by-block and
 * reassemble it into a TorrentInfo.
 *
 * Public API
 * ----------
 *   ext_fetch_metadata()   — high-level: connect to a peer list and return
 *                            a heap-allocated TorrentInfo (or NULL).
 *
 * The implementation is self-contained in src/proto/ext.c.

 * ext_fetch_metadata - try to download the info-dict from the given peers.
